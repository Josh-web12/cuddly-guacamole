This page contain an adequate amount of infomation regarding me. So if you want, you can take a look around and maybe even give some feedbacks 🩵🩵🩵.</div>
    <h3 class="content-text">Anyhow, let me introduce myselft O(∩_∩)O</h3>
    <h4 class="content-text" style="font-size: medium;">🪄Firstly, even thought this might sound weird since i do not uses english in real life much but here you can call me Aiden. I came up with it about 5 or 6 years back(it is currently 2024) so it does not have any deep meanings. 🤖 Secondly, I have some interests in coding/ programming and have dip my hand in it for a bit. I had some experiences with python, html, css, C but they are all surface level knowledge so i don not actually consider myself familiar with these languages yet. 🟪 Thirdly, this might be a suprise but i am into cartoons such as my little pony, helluva boss, killer drone,... Also some of the games that i have played and took and interest in are undertale 💀, deltarune🛡️, teamfortress 2 ❤️💙, oneshot 💡.</h4>
    <h5>I am focusing on school at the moment so this page will not be maintain as much but there will still be updates. That is all for me, you can use the nav bar to go to the rest of the site. Remember to be your self shine, improve, do what you want and like and most importantly relax.</h5>
